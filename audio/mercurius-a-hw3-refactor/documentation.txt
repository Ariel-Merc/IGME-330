For this project I coded in TypeScript.
I fixed all of the errors happening as a result of me directly using an HTML 
Element rather than setting it to a variable first and then using it. (This
includes every instance of e.target)
I fixed type errors that required me to cast the value of one thing to another,
usually the value of an HTML Element to a number.
Most of my warnings were caused by the fact that my variables did not
have explicit types. Therefore I went through the whole project and fixed that.
I used parameter destructuring on most of my functions. Functions with only one
parameter, I left alone.
Interfaces were moved out into their own files.
