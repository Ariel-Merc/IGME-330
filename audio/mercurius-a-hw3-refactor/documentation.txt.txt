Audio effects
I kept it pretty standard with bass and treble. I addeded two BiquadFilterNodes to the audio routing graph,
which modify th frequency of the original audio signal. The highshelf (treble) when enabled boosts high frequencies. 
The lowshelf (bass) when enabled boosts low frequencies.

Sprites
The main sprite with the most happening is the rain ripples. The Ripple class represents expanding circular waves 
that spawn across random points of the canvas in time with the music. These waves also eventually fade out and dissipate.
Next the fish class represents a visual element that orbits around the center of the canvas, responding to audio 
intensity by adjusting its speed. I think this could have been fine-tuned more to make the speed change more obvious.
Finally, the wave of mini circles. This was not apart of it's own seperate class. A continuous wave of blue circles flows
from left to right, pulsing in time with the audio intensity. Again, I think this could have been fine-tuned more to give
the circles a more prominent pulse.

App data
I put the title, the audio files, and the UI toggle data inside the json file.

Aesthetics
Overall, I aimed to create a cohesive experience with thematic consistency. The koi pond theme felt perfect. Most of the 
major elements I added were each created with the idea of this unifying theme in mind. I believe in that aspect, I have 
accomplished what I set out to do. I would rate my improvements at 12%. I did not do a big overhall, so I would not
really consider this a portfolio piece. However, the attention to thematic detail and refined visual effects made 
a much more immersive and polished experience compared to the original homework.
